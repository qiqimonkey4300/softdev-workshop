Prediction: Accessing the file via http://localhost:5000/static/foo will open the foo.html file in the static directory. 

Actual: Clicking the address makes us download the foo file. 
On Firefox it opens the address bit displays nothing. On Chrome it only downloads the file. 
If we change the ending of the address to foo.html, it'll display the html.
