**File I/O:** We started by saving the csv file in the same directory, and we used the csv.reader to read the file and split up each line. This directly filtered through each line in the file, identifying the job and the percentage. We then stored the job/percentage pairs into a dictionary for later use. 

**Dictionary:** Dictionaries are good for corresponding elements, and its structure allows for a quick reference to each value. To populate a dictionary, you must pair a key with a value. The value can be accessed with a known key.

**List:** Lists are used for multiple related elements. Each element can be referenced through their index. The order can be rearranged if necessary, making it useful for sorting elements. To populate a list, the elements are predefined or added in at various placements.

**Github-flavored markdown:** Github markdown is a way to style plain text in a similiar way to HTML. For example, dfferent sized headers can be achieved by putting # in front of a line (more # means smaller text). You can also use * or _ to italicize or bold. Overall, it allows for better legibility and understanding of files.

**Weighted randomized selection:** Start by choosing a random number in the total range. Subtract the individual weights from that number until you reach zero or less. The corresponding element you end up with is your weighted randomized selection.
