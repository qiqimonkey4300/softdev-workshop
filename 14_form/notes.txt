K14: Form and Function/making forms and printed a greeting using the form
2021010-14

-only creates a form in "/" because that's the only time you call render_template
-once you submit it takes you to "/auth"
-we wanted to use the variable username to return a greeting
-ended up needing to use request.args['username'] in app.py
-we weren't sure what was meant by "include request method used", after talking to classmates from both periods we came to a consensus that we should just return the request that was also printed in the terminal in the template app.py
