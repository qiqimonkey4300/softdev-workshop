# SUMMARY OF TRIO DISCUSSION
# Decided on combining the code, using both approaches based on number of arguments passed on the command line
# If two filenames are given, the program will use those files to create the period lists
# If none are given, the user is prompted to provide the names directly, using 'exit' to stop the input
# DISCOVERIES
# Needed to properly sanitize and handle exceptions in user input
# QUESTIONS
# Should the names be pulled randomly?
# And should period size be taken into account when choosing the random name?
# COMMENTS
# N/A
