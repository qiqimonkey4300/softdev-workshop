#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
Prediction: Without the render_template command, the second @app.route() call can't run on the localhost.
Actual: In firefox this error is produced instead of the html file: NameError: name 'render_template' is not defined.

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Prediction: https://localhost.5000/my_foist_template
Actual: Yes, this will load the page. 

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
Prediction: model_tmplt.html, is the html file name, the foo argument is the title, the collection argument is the list that the for loop is parsing through.
Actual: Our predictions were right, the render_template command, takes the html file and fills out the fields with the arguments given in the command. 


is the {{ }} notation specific to flask, or can other microframeworks interpret it as well?
