10-04-2021

QCC:
- All three of us used different methods to achieve a weighted average
- All of us separated the main file into different functions.
- HTML vs combining everything in a single file for display
- Different interpretations of the assignment list displayed
- We decided that using HTML files for a table would be best
- Moving up the import and instantation lines in the app.py fixed our bugs in our html file 
- We looped through a dict in the html file as opposed to hard coding all the data
EGO:
- Don't be too possessive of your code becuase if forcibly makes you more defensive of it against errors
- Have multiple people review your code
    - Makes reviewers better programmers in the process
- Egoless Programming results in increased efficiency when multiple programmers can understand the code
- As a reviewer you can also become attached to code so it's best to allow others to review it as well
