2021-12-02
time spent:

DISCO
- Two CDNs are linked at the top.
- Class types basically take care of most things.

QCC
- Dynamic elements are easier to use.

Q0
- No (there were comments in the code, and the layout was easy to understand)

Q1
- Bootstrap preferred because it's easier to learn and use.
- It also makes more sense (to us).
