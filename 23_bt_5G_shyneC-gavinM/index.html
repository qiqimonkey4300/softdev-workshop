      <h1>Intro to Chinese Characters</h1>
      <p>Many people are intimidated when they first see Chinese characters. Chinese people typically know around 4,000 characters. Completely different characters may also sound the exact same. Each character is one "syllable," and sometimes one character can have multiple pronunciations. Context matters when reading Chinese.</p>
      <p>Characters are usually strung together as phrases, though each character does usually have its base meaning.</p>
      <p>It's a pretty complicated language to learn, so here's a couple key things that might make this language feel easier and more approachable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-xxl my-4 bd-layout">
      <div class="shadow p-3 mb-3 bg-body rounded">
        <h3 id="makeup">Makeup of Characters</h3>
      </div>
        <!-- put some accordian here: shape(水、火), meaning, sound  -->
        <p>Many characters can usually be broken up into different parts. It's very interesting to take apart Chinese characters. Here are a few keys.</p>

                    <p>Spoil alert: It means water.</p>

                  <p>With pictographs in mind, let's look at this character: 木. This character means wood (it comes from a tree shape).</p>
                  <p>There are characters with parts that hint at their meaning. 木 is a common part found in characters that have to do with wood/trees. It's a radical.</p>
                  <p>A couple examples are 果(fruit), 架(shelf/frame), 杯(cup), 枯(wilt)</p>
                  <p>Now you might think, some of these characters don't seem to have much to do with wood and trees. But they do. For example, in ancient times, shelves and frames were made of wood. And with such an ancient language, it would make sense that it holds to ancient context.</p>

                      DISCLAIMER: Some characters take on multiple meanings as time passes. So, characters like 果 can mean a number of things, depending on how it's used.

                  <p>Ah, but what if you forget how to read this one character? Or what if you've never seen this character. There's only about 3,999 other characters floating around in your mind. </p>
                  <p>Do not worry! You might just be able to guess the character. </p>
                  <p>Some characters have components that actually have a similar sound or are part of a character that has a similar sound.</p>
                  <p>Let's look at this character: 妈, which means mother. We're going to break this up into its left and right sides: 女 and 马. 女 means female and 马 means horse. (PICTOGRAPHS!! They do look like it!!) So now, the left side makes sense. But what about the right side? 马 has a similar pronunciation to 妈. </p>

        <h3 id="stroke">Strokes</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Now, each character are actually made up of mainly eight types of strokes.</p>
      <p>The eight: horizontal (一), vertical (丨), left-falling (丿), right-falling (丶), rising (lower element of 冫), dot (、), hook (亅), and turning (乛, 乚, 乙, etc.)</p>
      <p>There are some rules about these strokes that dictate the stroke order of each character.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Horizontal strokes before vertical strokes</li>
        <li>Left strokes before right strokes</li>
        <li>Characters are written from top to bottom</li>
        <li>Characters are written from left to right</li>
        <li>First the inside of the character, then the outside</li>
        <li>Middle of the character first, then the sides</li>
      </ul>
